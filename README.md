This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The main task was to build a registration form with the use of [recompose](https://github.com/acdlite/recompose) library.
Main focus was on splitting logical and UI components, as well as using composition of logical components to create a complex UI component.
